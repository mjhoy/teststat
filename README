This will keep track of stats for you while you code.

(Inspired by zed shaw's peepcode screencast.)

disclaimer: work in progress. Database will likely not 
survive between updates, for now, as schema changes.

Just works w/ minitest for now.
---

Tracks, for each test command:

  * test failures
  * test errors
  * length in milliseconds the command ran
  * exit status of the command

Writes the results of each test to some sort of DB in
the current working directory.

Run your tests by giving a minitest command to `bin/record`:

    bin/record ruby test/test_my_test.rb

record runs "ruby test/test_my_test.rb" and parses the
output, and writes to a SQLite3 database at "~/.teststats.db".

Uses git:

each test run is associated with:

- a project, represented by the initial git commit SHA
  of the current working directory, and

- a user, represented by the output of 
  `git config --get user.email`.
