This will keep track of stats for you while you code.

(Inspired by zed shaw's peepcode screencast.)

Tracks:

  * errors
  * test failures
  * times test run

Writes the results of each test to some sort of DB in
the current working directory.

Run your tests using `bin/record`:

    bin/record ruby test/test_my_test.rb

which parses and collects the data to disk.

Output statistics with

    bin/stats
